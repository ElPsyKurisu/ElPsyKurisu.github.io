            <p>Here we see the blueprint of the vector magnet as it was machined to the original spec before we attach the magnets made in our magnet maker! Unfortunately a quick glance tells you all you need to know about how strong of a field we could get from the magnet as the pole shapes are quite sub-optimal. Not sure what was going in my head right there as I reflect on this years laters (a quick search through my old photos showed a schematic where we can lay a glass slide atop the pieces and use the stray field as our field but for obvious reasons this is problematic). I also apoligize that the CAD is not quite the final product but just image only the matching pole piece was made 4 times.</p>

            <p>Here we see the vector magnet in its final form, ready to be used in our ST-FMR setup (or not)! I cannot in good conscience claim full ownership of this design as our undergrad Julian helped with the pole pieces of the fixed design and him and my labmate Liang wound most of the remaining magnets -- at least until an unfortunate accident. Hint: Look closely at the botom coil what do you notice? When we run these magnets they can get quite hot -- in fact in the process of making the magnet you actually end up shorting the coils to melt the thermoplastic coating of the wires to solidy the coils shape. What do you think happens when after its solidified we ramp up the current even further?</p>

                This project holds a special place in my heart and like the ST-FMR system took MUCH longer to complete than I had originally anticipated. In fact, it was only fully operational (including code automation) the day BEFORE undergrad students taking my lab class had to use it -- whew.
