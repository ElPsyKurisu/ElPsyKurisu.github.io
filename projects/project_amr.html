            <p>First we need a flat base to connect the motor too. So I took some careful measurements and machined an aluminum assembly at the precise angle to screw into the magnet (which thankfully had some holes depressed inside its container). I think this part was rather fun and a little nerve racking trying to create the counterbores at a 45 degree angle. I learned a few things from my previous endeavors and measured not once, not twice, but thrice before I cut. I think it turned out pretty well if I may say so.</p>

            <p>Next we need to mount the motor to the aluminum assembly to allow us to mount a rod to the system. I think its fun to look back at my exquisite engineering drawings that allowed such precise craftsmanship to work. A quick glance to the left and the right of the engineering drawing shows excellent agreement with what we drew up. Now all thats left to do is attach the assembly to the magnet and figure out a way to connect the shaft of the motor to the rod holding the carrier PCB.</p>

            <p>We must have some PCB to mount our sample too (right image) but how do we mount our PCB to the rod which mounts to the shaft of the motor?. Our sample has to go into the center of the sample so we cant place a throughhole there so I opted for the solution in the CAD model. Note that it's quite different than how it was actually machined, since we realized it would be much easier to just make notches for the cables to escape. To allow for variable height, I opted to use a thorlabs post holder to allow one to secure a garolite rod (quite rigid and machinable) in between the post holder and set screw to adjust the height. This is shown in the final image above.</p>

            <p>The final machining related task is fixing the housing of the power supply since when it was shipped to us (from MIT) one of the wheels broke quite badly. The wheel was bent so badly it could not be replaced and the connection points were quite weak among the other wheels I opted for a more robust solution of buying a dolly to support the several 100lb power supply and machined some brackets to screw the housing directly into the dolly allowing us to wheel the power supply around with peace of mind. Now I would be more than happy to include tons more photos of me actually fixing the power supply but man this is getting way longer than I envisioned. Just know we had to replace broken fuses and power BJT's several times during testing. I will not be posting the schematic of the power supply as I did not design it and all credit goes to David Bono (are you sensing a pattern yet?).</p>
            <p>Part II: The Carrier PCB</p>

            <img src="../images/Research/build/AMR/Carrier PCB 3d.png" alt="Carrier 3D">
            <p>Above we have the Schematic (no idea why some stuff is crossed out), Layout, and 3d model of the Carrier PCB. Please note this are the files from the second version of the PCB, or at least the second batch I ordered. I don't believe I changed much between versions except the order paramters as I'm sure you'll see soon.</p>

            <img src="../images/Research/build/AMR/AMR_carrier_pcb_wiring.jpg" alt="Carrier wiring">
            <p>I hope its quite clear why I had to reorder some new PCBs from the first image. If not feel free to check out my MOKE PCB page -- I seem to never learn. However, just like the MOKE case all was not lost as I could test to see how the PCB fit between the poles and you can see a small gap on either side meaning I at least got better at measuring. In case you didn't figure it out yet, I forgot to order ENIG plating (which is required if you want to wirebond to the PCB). The last image shows the v2 PCB with the wiring as they stay and slide inbetween the slots carved out of the adapter plate mentioned in the first part. Unfortunately, this system means that it is quite tedious to change samples and I am looking to create an adapter PCB that can slot in with pogo legs (This was vetoed by David due to extra noise considerations but I think experimentation is worth it).</p>

                This project holds a special place in my heart and like the ST-FMR system took MUCH longer to complete than I had originally anticipated. In fact, it was only fully operational (including code automation) the day BEFORE undergrad students taking my lab class had to use it -- whew. This project is really split into three parts: The build, The Carrier PCB, and The Amplifier PCB. As a result I apoligize in advance for the length of this page. Without further ado, let's understand what I was tasked with building. It was aptly to be called, the 'Transport Measurement Setup', but I will default to AMR for now since that is what I used it for first. Basically, we want to be able to connect to our sample (which will be wirebonded to a PCB that I will have to design) and we would like to have that rotate in the field of the given magnet which we already have. Seems simple enough, and since I never learn any better, I decided to throw in an extra challenge. Typically, when taking transport measurements that yield very small signals, we use a lock-in technique. I won't go into the specifics of why or how, but just know its important. So a quick look at our spec sheet of the SRS 830 tells us we should expect about 6nv/sqrt(Hz) of noise which is quite good. But after spending too much time around David up at MIT I wanted to build my own amplifier and with Davids help we would target an amplifier capable of 4nV/sqrt(Hz). So now my task is to create machine the necessary parts and connect a motor to a shaft where we mount our carrier PCB that holds our sample. Then this can rotate freely and this must connect to a secondary PCB where we can break out the connection to BNC connections to go to our instruments (as well as amplifying our signal). Now this must ALL be done within the constraints of the given magnet, which yields us with less than 1" between the poles that we have to mount a PCB too, a connection method, and <strong>6</strong> coax connections. Did I mention we have a less than 1 inch (and the pcb has to rotate so think a circle of diameter &lt;1"). Luckily, we can use U.FL connecters to drastically reduce our footprint size and they are rather cheap and abundant, albeit a pain to solder the receptacles and the cables break easily. But alas, it will all be worth it. So with that in mind we can tackle desiging the AMR system and again relying on David to give us a power amplifer to power our ancient magnet.
